This script allows for decryption of data encrypted with various encryption algorithms such as AES-256-CBC. It supports different scenarios where one or more parameters are known, including private key, IV, ciphertext, encryption algorithm, BTC address, and passphrase.
VersaDecryptor - Decryptor for various encryption algorithms

Version: 1

This script allows for decryption of data encrypted with various encryption algorithms such as AES-256-CBC.
It supports different scenarios where one or more parameters are known, including private key, IV, ciphertext,
encryption algorithm, BTC address, and passphrase.

Usage:
    python VersaDecryptor.py

Note: This is an alpha version and should be used for testing and educational purposes only. Use it responsibly
and ensure you have the necessary permissions to decrypt the data.

Feel free to copy and use this code for your development and testing purposes. Remember to add your custom code for deriving private keys, IVs, and handling other encryption algorithms as needed.
