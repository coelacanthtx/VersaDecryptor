VersaDecryptor - Decryptor for Various Encryption Algorithms

Version: 2.1.1

Overview:
VersaDecryptor is a versatile decryptor program that supports various encryption algorithms and scenarios. It allows for the decryption of data encrypted with algorithms such as AES-256-CBC, AES-256-ECB, DES, 3DES, RSA, and more. It handles different scenarios where one or more parameters are known, including private key, IV, ciphertext, encryption algorithm, BTC address, and passphrase.

Features:
- Decrypt data encrypted with various encryption algorithms.
- Support for multiple encryption algorithms, including AES-256-CBC, AES-256-ECB, DES, 3DES, RSA, and more.
- Handle different scenarios with known parameters such as private key, IV, ciphertext, encryption algorithm, BTC address, and passphrase.
- Interactive mode for user-friendly input and decryption process.
- Retrieve and display the balances of Bitcoin addresses.
- Calculate the grand total balance of multiple Bitcoin addresses.

Usage:
1. Install Python (version 3.6 or above) on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the VersaDecryptor script.
3. Open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory containing the VersaDecryptor script using the `cd` command.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the VersaDecryptor script using the command: `python VersaDecryptor.py`.
6. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information to decrypt the data or retrieve Bitcoin address balances.

Note:
- This program is an alpha version and should be used for testing and educational purposes only.
- Use it responsibly and ensure you have the necessary permissions to decrypt the data or access Bitcoin address balances.

Dependencies:
- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- cryptography package
